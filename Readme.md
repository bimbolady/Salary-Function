### Salary Function Assignment

#### How to access code
- The python code base is stored inside a Jupyter notebook called `SalaryFunction.ipynb`
- The R codebase is written inside a Jupyter notebook called `SalaryFunctionR.ipynb`


### How to use python code
- The python codebase contains multiple cells that represent tasks for each instruction listed in the assignment module.
- The first cell imports the required salary data from a designation folder. In this case, this folder is where all of our project files reside.
- The second cell represents task two, which is to create a function that returns employee details when a name is inputted as an argument when the function is called. The function is called `getEmployeeDetails` and it receives one argument during function call.
- The third cell represents task three, which is processing data using python's dictionary data structure. The dictionary data structure represents data in key-value pairs. I created a function called `processSalaryData` which returns a dictionary that contains `EmployeeName` as key and `TotalPayBenefits` as value. The `TotalPayBenefits` is used to represent the salary.
- The codebase also showcases error-handling practices in different cases such as if a file is not found.
- The fourth cell represents task five. I created a function to export employee details into a lone csv and this csv file is also moved into a folder called Employee Profile. The Employee Profile is then compressed into a zip file containing the csv file.
- Additionally, I have added sample function calls to showcase how each function works and what type of data it will return.

### How to use R code
The R code base contains code to extract data from the zipped folder.
